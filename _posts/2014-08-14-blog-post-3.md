The system is defined as:

\[
X_{t+1} = 
\begin{cases}
 a X_t (1 - X_t) & \text{with probability } p, \\
\begin{cases}
2X_t & \text{if } x < 0.5, \\
2(1 - X_t) & \text{if } x \geq 0.5,
\end{cases} & \text{with probability } 1-p,
\end{cases}
\]

The logistic map, \( f_1(x) = a x (1 - x) \), exhibits chaotic behavior for \( a \in [3, 4] \). The tent map, \( f_2(x) \), also displays chaos with a uniform invariant density. Combining these maps stochastically creates complex dynamics. The parameter \( p \) controls the dominance of \( f_1 \) over \( f_2 \). For \( p = 1 \), the system reduces to the logistic map; for \( p = 0 \), it reduces to the tent map. Intermediate \( p \) values produce rich bifurcation structures.

**Figure**: Simulation results: bifurcation diagrams for different values of \( p \). Note that as expected, we got the bifurcation diagram of the logistic map as \( p \) increases. Interesting phenomena happen for intermediate values.

Our new system is:

\[
X_{t+1} = 
\begin{cases}
 a X_t (1 - X_t) & \text{with probability } p, \\
\begin{cases}
bX_t & \text{if } x < 0.5, \\
b(1 - X_t) & \text{if } x \geq 0.5,
\end{cases} & \text{with probability } 1-p,
\end{cases}
\]

We generated bifurcation diagrams for different \( (p, b) \) pairs by varying \( a \). The figure below shows four representative cases. For low \( p \), the tent map dominates, producing simpler dynamics. As \( p \) increases, the logistic map's influence grows, leading to more complex behavior. The parameter \( b \) further modulates these transitions. These results highlight the system's sensitivity to \( p \), \( b \), and \( a \), demonstrating the rich dynamics of the stochastic iteration map.

### 3D Plots and Further Analysis

The 3D plots show \( a \) on the \( X \)-axis, \( b \) on the \( Y \)-axis, and \( X_t \) on the \( Z \)-axis. Along with the 3D plots, we can see how bifurcation diagrams look for different \( (a, b) \) pairs when \( p \) is fixed.

The interplay of probability and chaos in our stochastic iteration map reveals a fascinating aspect of nonlinear dynamics: the role of randomness in shaping bifurcations. As observed, the probability parameter \( p \) biases the system towards either the logistic map (\( p \to 1 \)) or the tent map (\( p \to 0 \)), yet its intermediate values lead to an intricate blend of both, producing emergent behaviors beyond mere superposition. The transition is not smooth but punctuated by abrupt changes in bifurcation structures, underscoring the profound sensitivity of chaotic systems to probabilistic influence. 

As highlighted in discussions on nonlinear dynamics, the presence of stochasticity in deterministic maps does not merely introduce noise; it reshapes the entire dynamical landscape. The coexistence of distinct chaotic regimes governed by different maps illustrates how small probabilistic biases can lead to vastly different long-term behaviors. This reflects broader themes in nonlinear science, where even minor perturbations in governing rules lead to macroscopic changes, a principle deeply connected to real-world complex systems—from climate models to population dynamics.

Furthermore, the addition of a secondary parameter \( b \) amplifies this complexity, allowing for richer control over the system’s evolution. By varying both \( p \) and \( b \), we expose the fragile balance between order and chaos, reinforcing the fundamental idea that deterministic chaos is not simply disorder but a structured, rule-driven unpredictability. This study not only deepens our understanding of bifurcation phenomena but also aligns with the larger framework of stochastic dynamical systems, where probability is not just an external influence but an intrinsic architect of chaos.
