The system is defined as:

\[
X_{t+1} = 
\begin{cases}
 a X_t (1 - X_t) & \text{with probability } p, \\
\begin{cases}
2X_t & \text{if } x < 0.5, \\
2(1 - X_t) & \text{if } x \geq 0.5,
\end{cases} & \text{with probability } 1-p,
\end{cases}
\]

The logistic map, \( f_1(x) = a x (1 - x) \), exhibits chaotic behavior for \( a \in [3, 4] \). The tent map, \( f_2(x) \), also displays chaos with a uniform invariant density. Combining these maps stochastically creates complex dynamics. The parameter \( p \) controls the dominance of \( f_1 \) over \( f_2 \). For \( p = 1 \), the system reduces to the logistic map; for \( p = 0 \), it reduces to the tent map. Intermediate \( p \) values produce rich bifurcation structures.

### Simulation Results

#### Bifurcation Diagrams for Different Values of \( p \)

**Figure**: Simulation results: bifurcation diagrams for different values of \( p \). Note that as expected, we got the bifurcation diagram of the logistic map as \( p \) increases. Interesting phenomena happen for intermediate values.

Our new system is:

\[
X_{t+1} = 
\begin{cases}
 a X_t (1 - X_t) & \text{with probability } p, \\
\begin{cases}
bX_t & \text{if } x < 0.5, \\
b(1 - X_t) & \text{if } x \geq 0.5,
\end{cases} & \text{with probability } 1-p,
\end{cases}
\]

We generated bifurcation diagrams for different \( (p, b) \) pairs by varying \( a \). The figure below shows four representative cases. For low \( p \), the tent map dominates, producing simpler dynamics. As \( p \) increases, the logistic map's influence grows, leading to more complex behavior. The parameter \( b \) further modulates these transitions. These results highlight the system's sensitivity to \( p \), \( b \), and \( a \), demonstrating the rich dynamics of the stochastic iteration map.

#### Bifurcation Diagrams for Different \( (p, b) \) Pairs

*p = 0.2, b = 1.2*

![p = 0.5, b = 1.5](p2.png)  
*p = 0.5, b = 1.5*

*p = 0.7, b = 1.8*

![p = 0.9, b = 2.0](p4.png)  
*p = 0.9, b = 2.0*

### 3D Plots and Further Analysis

The 3D plots show \( a \) on the \( X \)-axis, \( b \) on the \( Y \)-axis, and \( X_t \) on the \( Z \)-axis. Along with the 3D plots, we can see how bifurcation diagrams look for different \( (a, b) \) pairs when \( p \) is fixed.
