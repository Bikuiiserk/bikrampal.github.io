Random walks are fundamental models in statistical physics, capturing phenomena from particle diffusion to financial markets. In this blog, we delve into a series of simulations that investigate how geometric constraints and resetting rules shape the angular distribution of a 2D random walker. The results reveal intriguing fractal patterns and parameter-dependent behaviors, offering insights into the interplay between stochastic motion and deterministic boundaries.

## **Simulation Overview**  
The simulations model a 2D random walk confined within a square boundary \( (|x| \leq b_x, |y| \leq b_y) \). The walker moves in diagonal directions (steps: \([\pm 1, \pm 1]\)), and if it exceeds the boundary, it is reset to a predefined *base curve*. Key variations include:  

1. **Reset Rules**:  
   - **CODE 1**: Walker returns to \( (a \cos\theta, a \sin\theta) \), where \(\theta\) is the exit angle.  
   - **CODE 2**: Walker returns to \( (a \sin\theta \cos^2\theta, a \cos\theta \sin^2\theta) \), introducing nonlinear dependencies.  

2. **Parameter Exploration**:  
   - **CODE 3**: Varies the radius multiplier \(a\) to study its impact on the angular distribution.


## **Key Results and Analysis**  

### **1. Angular Probability Density (PDF) and Zero-Probability Regions**  
Both CODE 1 and CODE 2 reveal regions of angles where the walker *never* returns (zero-probability regions). For example:  

- **CODE 1**: 34 discrete gaps (e.g., \(0.3047\) to \(0.3110\) radians).  
- **CODE 2**: Larger gaps (e.g., \(0.0031\) to \(0.4430\) radians), indicating stricter angular constraints.  

These gaps arise from the walker’s diagonal step choices and reset rules. In CODE 2, the nonlinear reset formula amplifies asymmetries, creating wider forbidden regions.  

### **2. Fractal Dimension of Return Angles**  
The fractal dimension (\(D\)) quantifies how densely the return angles fill the circle \([0, 2\pi]\):  

- **CODE 1**: \(D \approx 0.997\), near 1D (a nearly continuous distribution).  
- **CODE 2**: \(D \approx 0.768\), indicating a sparse, self-similar fractal.  

The polar plots (Figure 3, 7) visually confirm this: CODE 1’s angles are densely packed, while CODE 2’s form lacunary clusters.  

### **3. Cumulative Distribution (CDF) and Parameter Dependence**  
Varying \(a\) in CODE 3 shifts the CDF (Figure 9–11):  

- Smaller \(a\) (e.g., \(a=0.5\)): The walker resets closer to the origin, leading to frequent escapes and a CDF that plateaus unevenly.  
- Larger \(a\) (e.g., \(a=1.5\)): Resets occur farther from the boundary, reducing escape frequency and smoothing the CDF.  

A zoomed CDF (Figure 11) highlights how intermediate \(a\) values create stair-like steps, reflecting clustering at specific angles.  


## **Physical Interpretation**  

### **1. Reset Rules Dictate Symmetry**  
- CODE 1’s linear reset preserves rotational symmetry, yielding near-uniform coverage.  
- CODE 2’s nonlinear reset breaks symmetry, favoring angles where \(\sin\theta \cos^2\theta\) and \(\cos\theta \sin^2\theta\) dominate.  

### **2. Fractality from Constraints**  
The fractal dimension emerges from the walker’s "memory" of past resets. CODE 2’s lower \(D\) suggests stronger memory effects, akin to anomalous diffusion.  

### **3. Parameter Sensitivity**  
The radius \(a\) controls the trade-off between exploration (large \(a\)) and confinement (small \(a\)). This mimics biological foraging or particle trapping in porous media.  


## **Broader Implications**  
- **Modeling Natural Systems**: These simulations mirror constrained stochastic processes in biology (e.g., cell motion in tissues) and materials science (e.g., crack propagation).  
- **Fractal Geometry**: The spontaneous emergence of fractal angles underscores how simple rules can generate complexity, a hallmark of critical phenomena.  


## **Conclusion**  
By coupling random walks with deterministic resetting, these simulations bridge stochastic dynamics and geometric complexity. The results highlight how boundary conditions and reset rules shape statistical distributions—a concept applicable to fields from quantum transport to ecology. Future work could explore 3D extensions or adaptive reset rules, deepening our understanding of constrained stochastic systems.
