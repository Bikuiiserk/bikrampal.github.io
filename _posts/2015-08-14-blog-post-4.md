# Unraveling Fractals from Random Walks: Exploring CDFs, PDFs, and Zero-Probability Regions

In this blog post, we dive into a fascinating simulation that uses random walks to uncover fractal structures in returning angles. The code—written in Python—simulates a particle (or “walker”) constrained within a boundary and employs a deterministic return mapping when the walker exits that boundary. Over many iterations, the simulation records the angle at which the walker is returned to a predefined base curve. This process gives rise to intricate histograms and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) that reveal hidden fractal characteristics in the data.

## The Simulation Overview

At the heart of our simulation lies a two-dimensional random walk. The walker begins at the origin \((0, 0)\) and takes discrete steps in one of four diagonal directions. The simulation is designed with a couple of key parameters:

- **\(n\_steps\):** the total number of steps (often on the order of 1,000,000),
- **\(b_x\)** and **\(b_y\):** the boundaries in the \(x\) and \(y\) directions respectively.

When the walker’s new position falls outside these boundaries, the code computes the polar angle \(\theta\) using the `arctan2` function. This angle, adjusted to lie within the range \([0, 2\pi]\), is recorded as a “return angle.” The walker is then returned to the base curve by mapping the polar coordinates back to Cartesian coordinates using a rule that depends on a parameter \(a\) (the radius multiplier).

This basic mechanism is implemented in several versions of the code (labeled **CODE 1**, **CODE 2**, and **CODE 3**). Although they share the same core idea, each version tweaks the return mapping or explores the effect of varying parameters. For instance, in **CODE 1** the return is handled via the standard transformation:

$$x_{\text{new}} = a \cos(\theta), \quad y_{\text{new}} = a \sin(\theta)$$

whereas **CODE 2** uses a modified rule that involves both sine and cosine in a non-linear combination. **CODE 3**, on the other hand, runs multiple simulations with different \(a\) values to study how the distribution of returning angles changes with the mapping parameter.

## From Random Walk to Fractal Histograms

Once the simulation completes its random walk, the recorded angles are binned into a histogram over the interval \([0, 2\pi]\). The histogram essentially represents the probability density function (PDF) of starting angles—i.e., the fraction of returns that occur in each angular bin. However, as you explore the resulting histograms, you might notice that not every bin has a nonzero probability. Some regions show **zero probability**, meaning that the walker never returned to the base curve with those angles.

The code identifies these zero-probability regions and prints out intervals where the recorded fraction of starts is exactly zero. For example, an output might list regions such as:

- From \(0.3047\) to \(0.3110\) radians  
- From \(0.3990\) to \(0.4053\) radians  
- … and so on

These gaps are not merely numerical artifacts; they hint at the fractal nature of the underlying return process. The walker’s dynamics, despite being driven by simple random steps and a deterministic return rule, generate a distribution of angles that is highly irregular. In fact, the distribution can be singular in some regions—meaning that while the overall cumulative distribution function (CDF) exists, the probability density function (PDF) is not smooth or even defined in the classical sense over those intervals.

## CDF vs. PDF: When One Exists but the Other May Not

One might wonder: if the PDF appears to have gaps (or even “zero probability” intervals), how does the CDF manage to exist as a continuous function? The answer lies in the nature of integration. The CDF is defined as the cumulative sum (or integral) of the PDF. Even if the PDF is zero over some intervals, the CDF simply remains constant over those gaps—thus it is well defined.

In our simulation, the CDF is computed by taking a cumulative sum of the binned PDF data. When plotted, the CDF is shown as a step function that rises with each nonzero probability bin. Despite the erratic structure of the PDF, the CDF captures the aggregate probability and remains continuous (albeit with plateaus corresponding to the zero-probability regions). This phenomenon is an example of how cumulative functions can be smoother or more “well-behaved” than their density counterparts, especially in systems with fractal measures.

## Visualizing the Results

The code doesn’t stop at computing histograms. It goes further to create several plots that illuminate the behavior of the system:

1. **PDF Histogram:**  
   The code uses Matplotlib to plot a bar chart of the fraction of returns (the PDF) across 1000 bins spanning the interval \([0, 2\pi]\). Zero-probability regions are highlighted in red, drawing attention to the gaps in the distribution.

2. **CDF Plot:**  
   By computing the cumulative sum of the PDF, the CDF is plotted as a step function. This plot shows how probability accumulates with increasing angle. Even when the PDF drops to zero in certain regions, the CDF remains constant, demonstrating its continuous nature.

3. **Polar Fractal Visualization:**  
   Another intriguing plot uses polar coordinates to display the fractal structure of the return angles. Here, the occupied angles (bins with nonzero probability) are plotted in a circular layout. This visualization offers a glimpse into the self-similar and fractal characteristics emerging from the random walk.

4. **Box-Counting Dimension Estimation:**  
   To quantify the fractal nature of the return distribution, the code employs a box-counting method. By dividing the angular interval into various “boxes” and counting those that contain nonzero probability, the simulation performs a linear regression on log-transformed data to estimate the fractal dimension. In one simulation (CODE 1), the estimated fractal dimension was found to be approximately \(0.9973\)—indicating a near-linear structure in the return pattern. CODE 2, which uses a different return rule, yielded a fractal dimension around \(0.7682\), suggesting that the dynamics can be highly sensitive to the precise return mechanism.

5. **Multi-Parameter Analysis (CODE 3):**  
   CODE 3 extends the analysis by varying the radius multiplier \(a\). For different values of \(a\), multiple simulations are run and the CDFs of the returning angles are plotted on the same graph. This multi-simulation approach allows us to see how the choice of \(a\) influences the distribution. A zoomed version of the CDF plot further illustrates the fine-scale differences between various \(a\) values.

## Interpreting the Output

Let’s summarize some key outputs:

- **Zero-Probability Regions:**  
  The simulation prints out intervals where the walker’s return angles have zero probability. These regions emphasize that the PDF is not smooth and is punctuated by gaps—a hallmark of fractal distributions.

- **Fractal Dimension:**  
  The box-counting method outputs an estimated fractal dimension. In our examples, values ranged from roughly \(0.77\) to almost \(1.0\), depending on the return rule used. This dimension offers a quantitative measure of the complexity of the set of return angles.

- **Visual Plots:**  
  The PDF histogram (with highlighted gaps) and the step-wise CDF plot reveal two sides of the same coin: while the PDF might be discontinuous, the CDF provides an aggregated view that is smoother and easier to interpret. The polar plot visualizes the fractal structure in a more intuitive, circular format.

## The Curious Case: When CDF Exists but PDF Does Not

A central point of discussion in these simulations is the distinction between the existence of the CDF and the potential non-existence (or irregular behavior) of the PDF. In many physical and probabilistic systems, the CDF is well defined because it represents the integrated probability. However, if the underlying measure is singular or fractal, the PDF—defined as the derivative of the CDF—might not exist in a traditional sense everywhere.

In our simulation, although we compute a “PDF” by binning the data, the presence of zero-probability regions shows that the measure is not absolutely continuous. This means that while the cumulative probability (CDF) increases monotonically and continuously overall, its rate of change (the PDF) can be zero over nontrivial intervals. Such behavior is typical in fractal measures, where the probability is concentrated on a set of zero Lebesgue measure. In other words, the CDF exists and is perfectly well behaved as a function, but the PDF, when interpreted as a density with respect to the standard measure, is not defined in a classical way.

## Final Thoughts

The code presented in these simulations is an excellent demonstration of how simple rules—a random walk with a deterministic return mechanism—can give rise to complex, fractal-like distributions. Through careful recording and analysis of return angles, we obtain a PDF that is far from smooth, interspersed with zero-probability regions that reflect the fractal structure of the process. Yet, when we integrate this PDF to form the CDF, we recover a function that accumulates probability in a continuous manner.

Moreover, by tweaking the return mapping (as seen in **CODE 2**) and varying parameters (as in **CODE 3**), we observe that small changes in the system’s rules can have a profound impact on the fractal properties of the resulting distribution. The estimated fractal dimensions and the visualizations of the data underscore the sensitive dependence on these rules.

This exploration not only reinforces the importance of numerical simulations in understanding complex systems but also highlights the subtle interplay between probability density functions and cumulative distribution functions in fractal systems. While the CDF remains a robust and continuously defined entity, the PDF may reveal intricate gaps and irregularities—a fascinating phenomenon that reminds us that, in the world of fractals, intuition must sometimes give way to deeper mathematical insight.

Happy coding and exploring the hidden fractal structures in your own simulations!
